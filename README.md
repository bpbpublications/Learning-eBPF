## About the Book
Unlock the power of eBPF, the revolutionary Linux kernel technology transforming observability, networking, and security. This book serves as your comprehensive resource to master this cutting-edge technology, whether you are a beginner exploring its potential or a seasoned professional seeking in-depth knowledge.

Embark on a structured learning journey, starting with classic BPF (cBPF) and its evolution to modern eBPF, grasping its architecture and core programming primitives like the BPF syscall and various program/attachment types. Discover practical development using key eBPF programming libraries such as libbpf and bpftrace, and learn to write your first program. Explore BPF portability with CO-RE and efficient eBPF deployment. Uncover potent applications in eBPF observability (kprobes, tracepoints), eBPF networking (XDP, socket filters), and eBPF security. Finally, delve into key eBPF open-source projects like Cilium and Falco.

By the end of this definitive guide, you will possess a robust understanding of eBPF, equipped with the practical skills to develop, deploy, and leverage its immense capabilities across diverse domains, making you a proficient practitioner in this transformative field.
